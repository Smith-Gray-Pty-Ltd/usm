# USM Bugs — Discovered 2026-06-30

While authoring multi-tenancy / flow-designer / flow-execution features
against this version of USM (`@smithgray/usm@0.1.0`), I encountered the
following issues. All files were syntactically valid YAML but failed
either USM validation or YAML parsing. Filing here for the USM team.

## Bug 1: Schema validator uses `oneOf` without a discriminator

**Severity**: High — blocks all `$type: feature` and `$type: service` files from validating.

**Repro**:
```bash
$ pnpm usm validate path/to/feature.usm
✗ /path/to/feature.usm
  /: must have required property 'identity'      ← validator picked systemFile first
  /: must NOT have additional properties          ← systemFile doesn't allow $system
  /$type: must be equal to constant              ← strict equality on each oneOf branch
```

**Root cause**: In `src/validate.ts`, `ajv.compile(schema)` is called with
the full schema (which uses `oneOf` with three refs: `systemFile`,
`serviceFile`, `featureFile`). Without a `discriminator` field, AJV tries
each branch in order. For a feature file, the validator first checks it
against `systemFile` (which fails because it requires `identity`), then
`serviceFile` (fails on required fields), then `featureFile` (succeeds).
But `oneOf` semantics in AJV require EXACTLY ONE match — so even if
featureFile succeeds, the other branches also matching specific
properties means the overall `oneOf` can fail.

**Expected behavior**: Schema should either:
1. Add a JSON Schema `discriminator` with `propertyName: "$type"` mapping to the three branches, OR
2. Use `anyOf` instead of `oneOf` (more permissive — file just needs to match ONE branch), OR
3. The validator should manually select the right schema based on `$type` before calling AJV.

**Suggested fix**: In `src/validate.ts`, add a pre-check:
```typescript
function pickSchemaForType(file: UsmFile): object {
  switch (file.$type) {
    case "system": return systemSchema;
    case "service": return serviceSchema;
    case "feature": return featureSchema;
    case "data": return dataSchema;
    case "api": return apiSchema;
  }
}
const validate = ajv.compile(pickSchemaForType(file));
```

## Bug 2: YAML parser chokes on embedded colons in unquoted strings

**Severity**: Medium — common in prose fields like rationale, summary, description.

**Repro**: A YAML value like:
```yaml
rationale: Langflow's UI is functional but not Vercel-style. A custom React Flow UI gives us branded UX. Langflow handles: LLM provider integration, 3rd-party OAuth.
```

...fails to parse with:
```
YAMLException: bad indentation of a mapping entry (42:172)
```

**Root cause**: YAML treats `:` followed by space as a key:value separator.
The text "Langflow handles: LLM provider" gets parsed as `Langflow handles`
key with value `LLM provider integration`. The rest of the text becomes
garbage.

**Suggested fixes** (pick one):
1. **In USM's docs**: Tell users to quote any string that contains a colon. Wrap with single quotes:
   ```yaml
   rationale: 'Langflow handles: LLM provider integration, 3rd-party OAuth.'
   ```
2. **In USM's serializer**: Add a YAML serializer that auto-quotes values containing `:` or `"` or `'`.
3. **In USM's parser**: Use `yaml.load` with options that are more lenient with embedded colons. The `yaml` library has a `customTags` option.

## Bug 3: `featureFile` schema doesn't include `interfaces` in $defs

**Severity**: Low — schema has the field but only in one location.

While testing, I found that `featureFile` includes `interfaces`, `contracts`,
`tests`, etc. but the documentation doesn't make clear which fields are
required vs optional. The schema uses no `required` array, so all are
optional. This means feature files can be created without `decisions`
or `flows` etc. — and that's actually fine, but the docs should say so.

**Suggested improvement**: Add a section to README explaining which
fields are recommended vs optional.

---

## Bug 4: `npm install @smithgray/usm` URL-encoding bug

**Severity**: Medium — affects all install methods.

**Repro**:
```bash
$ npm install @smithgray/usm
npm error 404 Not Found - GET https://registry.npmjs.org/@smithgray%2fusm - Not found
$ npm view '@smithgray/usm'
npm error 404 - GET https://registry.npmjs.org/@smithgray%2fusm - Not found
```

**Root cause**: npm's URL-encoding logic double-encodes the `@smithgray`
scope (or fails to match the package metadata URL). The tarball URL
`https://registry.npmjs.org/@smithgray/usm/-/usm-0.1.0.tgz` works fine
when accessed directly. The package IS published and installable.

**Workaround**: Pin to a specific version:
```bash
npm install '@smithgray/usm@0.1.0'
# OR install via tarball URL:
npm install https://registry.npmjs.org/@smithgray/usm/-/usm-0.1.0.tgz
```

**Suggested fix**: Could be a known npm CLI bug, not USM itself. Worth
filing at https://github.com/npm/cli if reproducible with other
hyphen-less scopes.

## Bug 5: `usm generate --check` doesn't show which files are out of date in a friendly way

**Severity**: Low — UX issue, not a bug per se.

When running `pnpm usm generate --check`, the output is a flood of `✗ file: missing` and `✗ file: out of date` messages. There's no summary at the top showing how many files are stale, no color, and no grouping by service/feature. For a project with 100+ generated docs, this is hard to scan.

**Suggested improvement**: Group output by:
- Files that need to be created
- Files that need to be updated
- Files that are up to date (with count)

Add a summary header:
```
=== USM Generate Check ===
✗ 3 files need updating
✓ 47 files are up to date

Out of date:
  ✗ apps/tenant/.usm/features/admin/flow-designer.usm
  ✗ apps/tenant/.usm/features/admin/flow-execution.usm
  ✗ infrastructure/services/langflow/.usm/services/langflow.usm
```

## Bug 6: `usm generate` doesn't handle `flow-execution.usm` files correctly

**Severity**: Medium — generator issue.

The `usm generate` command doesn't pick up the new `apps/tenant/.usm/features/admin/flow-execution.usm` file because the generator's `feature-file` template doesn't recognize the `decisions[]`, `flows[]`, `contracts[]` arrays we use. Looking at the source code in `src/generators/markdown.ts` (lines 523, 644, 774, 1371, etc.), these arrays are rendered as separate sections but the connection back to the schema's optional `risk.severity` field isn't fully wired.

**Suggested fix**: Verify generator templates render all new fields we use:
- `risk.severity` field (high/medium/low)
- `risk.mitigation` field
- `test.expect` array (vs singular)
- `flow.steps[].expect` array
- `flow.steps[].action` enum
- `decision.alternatives` array

## Bug 7: YAML unquoted colons in long text fields

**Severity**: Medium — frequently hits during USM authoring.

**Repro**: A multi-line rationale or description that contains phrases like:
- `LLM Chat` (no problem on its own)
- `POST to /api/flows` (colon inside)
- `ssr: false` (colon + space inside)
- `Use dynamic import with ssr: false in Next.js; or 'use client' directive`
- Any string with `: <word>` patterns

**Error**:
```
YAMLException: bad indentation of a mapping entry (224:44)
  222 |  ... flow-ssr
  223 |  ... reactflow requires browser-only APIs (window, document)
  224 |  ... n: Use dynamic import with ssr: false in Next.js; or 'use cli ...
  ------------------------------------------^
```

**Root cause**: js-yaml's safe loading treats `: <space>` as a key-value separator. When the value contains a colon (e.g., `Use dynamic import with ssr: false`), the parser interprets everything after the colon as a nested mapping.

**Fix in USM authoring**:
- Always wrap long text values in single quotes: `'value with: colons'`
- Or use the `|` block scalar:
  ```yaml
  rationale: |
    This is a long text
    with: colons
    and other punctuation.
  ```

**Suggested fix in USM tooling**:
- Add a YAML linter to `usm validate` that warns about unquoted strings containing `: ` patterns
- Or use `yaml` library's `safeLoad` with a custom resolver that auto-quotes suspicious strings
- Or document this in the README more prominently

**Frequency encountered**: hit 4-5 times in this session while writing USM specs for the agentic platform.

## Bug 8: oauth2-proxy shows Sign In page instead of auto-redirecting to OIDC

**Severity**: Medium — confusing UX, looks like the wrong service.

**Repro**: 
1. User visits `http://localhost:4180/` (oauth2-proxy)
2. Expected: 302 redirect to OIDC provider (Zitadel)
3. Actual: 403 with an HTML "Sign In" page (oauth2-proxy's built-in page with a button)
4. User has to click "Sign in" button before the OIDC redirect happens

**Root cause**: oauth2-proxy by default shows a sign-in page that requires a click, instead of auto-redirecting. This is for cases where multiple OIDC providers are configured and the user picks one.

**Fix**: Add `skip_provider_button = true` to oauth2-proxy config. The user is auto-redirected to the OIDC provider on the first unauthenticated request.

**Symptom that confused me**: The sign-in page is styled with `bulma.min.css` and looks similar to Langflow's login page, making it look like the user is being shown a Langflow login (but it's actually oauth2-proxy's "which OIDC provider?" page).
